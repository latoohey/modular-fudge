        "This notebook is used to run guided text generation using a trained causal classifier from the modular FUDGE project. It loads a base LLM and a trained classifier checkpoint to guide the output in real-time. For a complete overview of the project architecture please see the [full project on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/latoohey/modular-fudge). The training script to create a classifier for guiding generation is also available as a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zVfBB_zIKHpSANBmTcj8KRBFwsPgbd9m?usp=sharing)."
